# Project Title: Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm#
### Project Overview: ###
In this project, we will implement the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict the presence or absence of diabetes in patients based on a set of medical attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information about various health-related features that can influence the likelihood of diabetes. The SVM algorithm will allow us to identify that, whether the patient is Diabetic or Not.
