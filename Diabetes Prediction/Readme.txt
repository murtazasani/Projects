<h1>Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm</h1>
Project Overview:
In this project, we will implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on a set of medical attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information about various health-related features that can influence the likelihood of heart disease. The KNN algorithm will allow us to classify patients into different groups based on the similarity of their attributes.
